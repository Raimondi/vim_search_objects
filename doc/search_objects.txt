INTRODUCTION                                        *search-objects*

This plugin turns the results of a search (conducted using |search-commands|)
into a text object which can be manipulated using |motion| commands like |c|
and |d|.

MAPPINGS                                            *search-objects-mappings*

{a/} is a text object representing the complete match.

{i/} is a text object representing the text from the current cursor position to 
the end of the match.

EXAMPLES                                            *search-objects-examples*

Imagine you have the following text:

    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

To change the word brown to green, you can type this:

{/brow} to search for the string "brow"

{n} to advance to the first result.

{ca/} to change the match.

{gree}<Escape> to type the new text.

The benefit of using search objects over word objects becomes apparent when
you have camel-case classnames like "DatabaseQueryResult". If you wished to
quickly change the substring "Query", the above process would let you do so
without affecting the parts that do not match the search result.
